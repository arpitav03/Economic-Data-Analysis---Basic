# Economic-Data-Analysis---Exploratory
Data scraping, cleaning and exploration of US Economic Data from FRED Website - Using Python Pandas
I have used Python Pandas and FRED Api to fetch economic data from ' https://fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/fred/#General_Documentation 'website.
In this particular project, I analyse the economic data related to Unemployement trends in teh various states of the US over the years.
This can be further used to know other factors or economic data like - participation rate etc. using same type of code set.
